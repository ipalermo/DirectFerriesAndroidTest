One of our junior developers decided to try to teach themselves Clean Architecture but got bogged down. It's a real mess and they need your help to get it up and running.

There is a list of cars in json format that should be display in a list. Help them get the cars asynchronously from the json file and display them to the user.

We don't expect you to correct everything but tackle the bits you think would demonstrate your knowledge of Clean Architecture to the junior and the use of Architectural Components within the context of the project. Introduce anything you think is missing or desirable.

Use tests to demonstrate the functionality if this is more congenial.

Please also track any changes in a Version Control System so we can see the progression.
